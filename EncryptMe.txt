This option prompts the user for a password (max 256 bytes long, may contain letters, digits, other characters) and then prompts the user for a filename and decrypts the content of the selected file using that password. The decryption method is very simple: just XOR the password with the file content byte after byte; the password being shorter than the file content, you must repeat the password as needed.
